	abstract = {When we see a piece of art or an archaeological object for the first time, a painting, a jewel, a sculpture or merely a simple piece of pottery on display in a museum or in an exhibition, we might be fascinated by its beauty or by its simplicity. However, many questions often arise in connection with such items on display, about its origin, its context, its provenance, its authenticity. Finding complete answers is a fully interdisciplinary task between art, humanities and natural sciences. With respect to the contribution from natural science, it often needs the application of just the best methods and techniques out of a multitude of possible options. Starting from a simple visual inspection with or without a magnifying glass, the techniques reach up to highly sophisticated and advanced methods developed in atomic physics, nuclear physics and chemistry, such as available at large scale facilities, and even biophysics. In the following, a condensed review is presented on recent research on cultural heritage objects using various radiation techniques.},

The unforeseen observation was made on silica-soda-lime glass mock-ups before and after their artificial ageing, using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) surface analysis techniques. The analyses showed a marked non-homogeneous element distribution at the glass surface. The results indicated a very low concentration of Na at the surface up to a depth of around 500 nm below the surface, where its concentration increases reaching a plateau. In addition, the profile distribution of H in the first 200 nm of the pristine glass surface indicated a diffusion of hydrogen from the surrounding environment to the glass network. Additional modifications during the glass ageing process related to external factors (such as temperature and humidity) were also identified in relation to sodium atoms, with atoms on the glass surface showing a different chemical state from those in the bulk. This study confirms that glass composition as well as glass alteration are non-homogeneous locally supporting the importance of studying glass surface as region of interaction with surrounding environment.},

IR signals for bioimaging and environmental sensing penetrate biological matrices (i.e. tissues) deeper and with less scattering than visible light. This work reports the effects of heating rate on the solid state synthetic yield of EB and formation mechanism is discussed. EB synthesis was investigated with thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry and in-situ high temperature X-ray diffraction. A reproducible maximum in EB yield was observed at a heating rate of 7 °C/min with samples containing CaCO3 precursor. We report the optimized reaction conditions, yields, and the photoluminescent response of the synthesized EB layered materials. The precursor content (O2, CaCO3, CuO and SiO2) also had a subtle effect on EB yield.},

The hydrothermal reaction conditions are surprisingly specific: too cold, and instead of CaCuSi4O10, a porous calcium copper silicate forms; too hot, and calcium silicate (CaSiO3) forms. The precursors also strongly impact the course of the reaction, with the most common side product being sodium copper silicate (Na2CuSi4O10). Optimized conditions for hydrothermal CaCuSi4O10 formation from calcium chloride, copper(II) nitrate, sodium silicate, and ammonium hydroxide are 350 °C at 3000 psi for 72 h; at longer reaction times, competitive delamination and exfoliation causes crystal fragmentation. These results illustrate that CaCuSi4O10 is an even more unique material than previously appreciated.},

	abstract = {In favourable conditions of low temperature and low oxygen concentration, archaeological waterlogged wooden artefacts, such as shipwrecks, can survive with a good state of preservation. Nevertheless, anaerobic bacteria can considerably degrade waterlogged wooden objects with a significant loss in polysaccharidic components. Due to these decay processes, wood porosity and water content increase under ageing. In such conditions, the conservation treatments of archaeological wooden artefacts often involve the replacement of water with substances which fill the cavities and help to prevent collapse and stress during drying. The treatments are very often expensive and technically difficult, and their effectiveness very much depends on the chemical and physical characteristics of the substances used for impregnation. Also important are the degree of cavity-filling, penetration depth and distribution in the structure of the wood. In this study, the distribution in wood cavities of some mixtures based on polyethylene glycols and colophony, used for the conservation of waterlogged archaeological wood, was investigated using synchrotron radiation X-ray computed microtomography (SR-µCT). This non-destructive imaging technique was useful for the study of the degraded waterlogged wood and enabled us to visualise the morphology of the wood and the distribution of the materials used in the wood treatments. The study has shown how deposition is strictly related to the dimension of the wooden cavities. The work is currently proceeding with the comparison of synchrotron observations with the data of the solutions viscosity and with those of the properties imparted to the wood by the treatments.},

	abstract = {Historical glass, especially non-durable medieval glass, can undergo corrosion. This sometimes results in the formation of dark-coloured manganese-rich inclusions that reduce the transparency of the glass. While unaltered bulk glass contains manganese mainly present in the +II valence state, inside the inclusions Mn is present in higher valence states (+III to +IV). Two different strategies may be considered by conservators when aiming to improve the transparency. One is based on the reduction of highly oxidised black/brown compounds using mildly reducing solutions, while the other focuses more on the extraction of manganese from the inclusions by the application of chelating agents. In this paper, a method for quantitative mapping of the Mn speciation inside partially corroded historical windowpanes based on X-Ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopy is discussed. The calibration of such Mn valence state maps based on the combo method, a fairly reliable way to determine the oxidation state, is described in more detail. This method is used to evaluate the effect of reducing treatments on historical glass, dated to the 14th century and originating from Sidney Sussex College (Cambridge, UK), suffering from Mn browning. Glasses were examined by means of Synchrotron Radiation (SR) based microscopic X-Ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (μXANES) spectroscopy and microscopic X-Ray Fluorescence (μXRF). X-Ray elemental distribution maps of glass cross-sections are recorded at different energies, while Mn K-edge spectra are used to convert these into Mn valence state (VS) maps. Such valence state maps will allow evaluation of a reducing treatment.},

	abstract = {Twenty-two objects of glass from the Decapolis city of Gerasa, N. Jordan, with characteristic vessel forms ranging from Hellenistic to Early Islamic (2nd century BCE to 8th century CE) were analyzed for major and trace elements, and 16 samples for Sr-isotopes. The majority were produced in the vicinity of Apollonia on the Palestine coast in the 6th–7th centuries CE, and strong inter-element correlations for Fe, Ti, Mn, Mg, Nb reflect local variations in the accessory minerals in the Apollonia glassmaking sand. The ubiquity of recycling is reflected in elevated concentrations and high coefficients of variation of colorant-related elements as well as a strong positive correlation between K and P. The high level of K contamination is attributed to the use of pomace (olive processing residue) as fuel, and a negative correlation with Cl, due to volatilization as the glass was reheated. This points to an efficient system for the collection of glass for recycling in Jerash during the latter part of the first millennium CE. Differences in elemental behavior at different sites in the Levant may reflect the context of the recycling system, for example, glass from secular contexts may contain less colorants derived from mosaics than glass associated with churches.},

	abstract = {The speed and effectiveness of a conservation treatment used for stained glass windows have been investigated. Dark-coloured Mn-rich stains can be found in the alteration layer of ancient glass artefacts and cause the surface to turn brown/black: this phenomenon is known as Mn-browning or Mn-staining. While in glass manganese is present in the +II or +III oxidation states, in the Mn-rich bodies, manganese is in a higher oxidation state (+IV). In restoration practice, mildly reducing solutions are employed to eliminate the dark colour and restore the clear appearance of the glass. In this paper the effectiveness and side effects of the use of hydroxylamine hydrochloride for this purpose are assessed. Archaeological fragments of stained glass windows, dated to the 14th century and originating from Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge (UK), were examined by means of synchrotron radiation (SR) based microscopic X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy (μ-XANES) and microscopic X-Ray Fluorescence (μ-XRF) and with high resolution computed absorption tomography (μ-CT) before, during and after the treatment. The monitoring of the glass fragments during the treatment allows us to better understand the manner in which the process unfolds and its kinetics. The results obtained reveal that the hydroxylamine hydrochloride treatment is effective, but also that it has a number of unwanted side effects. These findings are useful for optimizing the time and other modalities of the Mn-reducing treatment as well as minimizing its unwanted results.},

The great variety of size and composition that characterizes archaeological findings and art objects requires the development of tomographic systems specifically designed for Cultural Heritage analysis. In the last few years our research group has developed several acquisition systems for Digital Radiography and X-ray CT. We are able to perform high resolution micro-tomography of small objects (voxel size of few microns) as well as CT of large objects (up to 2 m of size). In this paper we will mainly focus the attention on the results of the investigation recently performed on two Japanese wooden statues with our CT system for large works of art.

In particular, knowledge transfer among research groups is required by the number of different conventional and advanced techniques which can be applied to ancient materials. One of the main requirements imposed by the archaeologists in the studies of ancient and precious materials is that the selected techniques must be non-destructive (or at most micro-destructive). In this scenario, synchrotron radiation-based methods can play a central role, being specifically suitable for micro-non-destructive analyses.

	abstract = {X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) has a significant role as investigation tool not only in medical and industrial applications but also in cultural heritage and anthropologic studies. It is a non-destructive examination test (NDT) to study different types of archaeological objects. Ordinary X-ray radiography is limited and gives 2D superficial images. On other hand, high-resolution X-ray CT imaging reveals different more complex 2D and 3D images. 3D CT imaging has gained wide acceptances for investigations that before could not be obtained by ordinary X-ray radiography only. Archaeological applications of CT scan have started to investigate the ancient Egyptian mummies which were elaborately wrapped and could not be investigated otherwise. X-ray CT investigation technique is not only exclusive for study the mummies but also for examination of different artifacts such as clay tablets, scrolls, pottery, wood, ceramics, stones, bronze statues, swords and other metal objects. This article focus on the use of Multi-Detectors Computed Tomography (MDCT) to study an ancient Egyptian falcon hollow-cast bronze coffin of the god Horus dated to Late period, 713-332 BC - Dynasties XXV-XXXI. The statue was used as a coffin for a votive falcon mummy from Cairo Egyptian Museum. The examination illustrates that the coffin was casted in one-piece hollow-cast without use of thermal or mechanical joints. 2D and 3D CT images provide overall geometry of the coffin and reveal all casting process components. 2D CT images give metric measurements of wall thicknesses throughout the coffin, which ranges 2.6–5.9 mm throughout the casting. 3D CT images reveal usage of two core materials and six chaplets to keep the balance of inner core inside the mold during manufacture the coffin. The attenuation values measurements in Hounsfield units (HUs) and standard deviation (SD) were used to estimate the types of two different core materials presence inside the coffin as a clay and stone material. The cross-section of the used chaplets is rectangle and there is a high probability that it is made of iron. There is suggestion that the air vent is located in the place of aperture behind the falcon statue head.},

The results suggested that these faience objects can be divided into two groups by using different flux: sajji-khar (a kind of plant ash) and mixed alkali flux; copper and iron were used as coloring elements in the blue and red faience; the forming technology of two groups of faience was similar:these beads were firstly formed on an organic cylinder and then glazed by using the efflorescence technique according to replica experiments and the structural information revealed by SR-μ CT slices. Up to our knowledge, the results firstly and scientifically confirm that the production of the Harappan faience beads adopts the efflorescence glazing method.

Situated at the northern extremity of the Levant, the site is already known in the literature as one that has produced rich and diverse glass artifacts. Investigations using scanning electron microscopy, synchrotron contrast, and diffraction tomography of a crucible fragment found in a multi-craft workshop context have confirmed that glassmaking occurred. This new and unique analytical evidence contributes the first data from a Syro-Levantine area to the discussions of early glassmaking centers. Prior studies on the origin of glass have given significant credit to Mesopotamia as the center of innovation, particularly because of the textual records and examples of early glass objects from the region. The current study also addresses the relationships and potential mismatches between textual and archaeological evidence. The discovery in Alalakh of a glassmaking crucible provides, for the first time, evidence for LBA glassmaking outside of Egypt and the core area of Mesopotamia, and it can be linked to descriptions of glassmaking in cuneiform tablets. We open a fresh avenue for scrutinizing and combining archaeological, textual, and scientific evidence for centers of innovation.},

In many cases, the degradation layer consists of numerous lamellae with a thickness between 0.1 and 10μm. However, both internal structure and formation process of laminated degradation layers remain unclear. In this paper, a model is proposed where we assume that transformed (degraded) glass consists of a random packing of nano-sized silica particles while the lamellae are the result of different packing densities. The model is able to connect the texture of numerous lamellae observed by several types of microscopic techniques with the structure at molecular level determined by means of chemical analysis. In addition, the model is able to explain numerous properties such as the parameters responsible for the contrast between lamellae. This contrast can be caused by differences in color, density, elemental composition, or surface roughness.},

	abstract = {Three fragmentary faces originally plastered on skulls are discussed : their excavation history, conservation treatment, and technical analysis. Deposited during the Pre-pottery Neolithic B in a shallow pit at the site of 'Ain Ghazal, Jordan, the modelled faces had apparently been broken off the skulls. Only plaster was found, and the absence of the skulls enabled many aspects of manufacture to be determined during reassembly. Skulls without their mandibles had been prepared by stuffing cavities with grass and coiling rope below the maxillae. Results of plaster analysis using a range of scientific techniques are presented. Stylistic and technical comparisons are made to other Neolithic plastered skulls, as well as to large statues found at the site. L'histoire de la découverte de trois « faces » modelées à l'origine en plâtre sur des crânes, les traitements de conservation ainsi que les techniques d'analyse sont présentées ici. Apparemment détachées des crânes ces « faces » avaient été déposées au cours du PPNB dans une fosse peu profonde de l'établissement d'Ain Ghazal (Jordanie). Lors des remontages, l'absence de crânes permit de faire une série d'observations sur leur mode de fabrication. Une fois la mandibule retirée, les cavités des crânes avaient été bourrées d'herbes et un rouleau de cordelette placé sous le maxillaire. Les résultats de l'analyse de Venduit de plâtre effectuée à l'aide de plusieurs techniques scientifiques sont présentés de même que sont faites des comparaisons stylistiques et techniques avec des crânes surmodelés trouvés sur d'autres sites néolithiques et avec les grandes statues retrouvées à Ain Ghazal.},

As assessed by conventional analytical tools, most of the initially metallic Ag coin had been converted to AgCl by exposure to the aggressive coastal burial conditions. X-ray computed microtomography proved that only small portions of the artefact had preserved their metallic nature. Since the engraving was preserved partly in the corrosion product bulk and partly in the metallic rests, electrodeposition of Ag from the AgCl layer, under controlled conditions ensuring shape preservation, resulted in the reconstruction of the coin surface with full recovery of the original engraving. Such optimal electrodeposition conditions were identified by a combination of electrochemical and quasi-in situ X-ray microtomography experiments, carried out with artificially corrored engraved Ag wires. Microtomography of the reconstructed coin confirmed the compaction of the external Ag layer and disclosed that the central core of the coin still contains unconverted AgCl. The presence of such a mineralised core does not however impact the numismatic use of the coin and the safeguard of the original engraving.},

	abstract = {The protection and conservation of our cultural heritage which is made of natural stone is of cultural and economic value. The interaction of natural stone-made surfaces with different chemical and physical, climatic controlled, weathering processes, leads to a rapidly increasing deterioration of these monuments. Several different methods are employed in order to conserve and restore these important structures. An effective technique of conservation and restoration is the use of chemical consolidants. One of the main tasks of stone consolidants is a deep penetration into the weakened fabric and the reconstruction of the grain binding strength. The three-dimensional distribution of the consolidants in weathered rock is important for the evaluation of this conservation procedure. Neutron Imaging due to the specific sensitivity of neutrons for hydrogen could be a very useful tool for non-destructive investigation of the chemical inside the restored sample. The method of neutron tomography gives a three dimensional (3D) mapping of the conservation agent in the sample. This paper presents the application of the method of neutron tomography for assessing the consolidation of valuable original samples from historical buildings and monuments in Austria.},

The structure of the red cosmetic sticks was disclosed by SR-μCT scanning (Synchrotron Radiation Micro-computed Tomography), while the chemical components were characterized by FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), Raman Spectroscopy and Proteomics. The results suggested that the cosmetic sticks were made from the cattle heart and covered with a layer of hematite powders as the pigment. Given the numerous red painted relics in Xiaohe Cemetery, this kind of cosmetic sticks might be used as a primitive form of crayon for makeup and painting. The usage of cattle hearts as cosmetic sticks is firstly reported up to our knowledge, which not only reveals the varied utilizations of cattle in Xiaohe Cemetery but also shows the distinctive religious function. Furthermore, these red cosmetic sticks were usually buried with women, implying that the woman may be the painter and play a special role in religious activities.},

	abstract = {.Coating systems in historical bowed string instruments are often multi-layered structures, where several inorganic and organic materials are variously combined. The methods to characterise such complex systems normally require samples to be detached from the artwork, whereas Synchrotron Radiation micro-Computed Tomography (SR-micro-CT) may reveal --through a non-invasive approach-- procedures and materials employed by the ancient violin makers. Since the application of SR-micro-CT for the investigation of the finishing layers in historical bowed string instruments is still unexplored, the experimental settings were optimized for the detection of the main features expected in the finishing layers of a historical instrument. In this work, two sets of mock-ups mimicking the finishing layers of historical instruments and a large fragment removed from a damaged cello by Andrea Guarneri were scanned. By considering SR-micro-CT data, and data obtained by previous micro-invasive analyses, the merits of reconstructed volumes and virtual slicing in investigating the layered structures have been highlighted and discussed. The developed procedures enabled the detection of the main morphological features of the overlapping layers, producing a valuable, non-invasive insight into the structure of the coating systems.},

The use of different analytical techniques, including synchrotron radiation computed micro-tomography (micro-CT), Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating, Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), has shown that the exposed area of dentine resulting from occlusal wear and the upper part of a vertical crack affecting enamel and dentin tissues were filled with beeswax shortly before or after the individual’s death. If the filling was done when the person was still alive, the intervention was likely aimed to relieve tooth sensitivity derived from either exposed dentine and/or the pain resulting from chewing on a cracked tooth: this would provide the earliest known direct evidence of therapeutic-palliative dental filling.},

	abstract = {Archaeological bone, ivory and antler, as well as objects manufactured from them, are largely studied to extract as much information as possible from these materials. Among others, one key question in archaeology is the exact identification of the material. Even if the identification of different kinds of osseous material seems to be trivial in many cases, it can be a difficult issue when small, heavily carved and more or less altered ancient objects are concerned. This study was focused on the determination of parameters allowing the distinction of archaeological ivory, bone and antler in order to identify the raw material used for the manufacture of prehistoric objects. The high performance of synchrotron radiation (SR) and laboratory-based micro X-ray computed tomography (microCT), providing highly resolved three-dimensional information on the micromorphology, permitted the establishment of such distinctive features of modern references of ivory, antler, land mammal and whale bones: ivory shows characteristic tubular pores with a diameter of about 1 to 2 μm, bone and antler show typical osteon structures. In our measured references, antler shows on average larger and more elongated shaped pores of the osteons compared to terrestrial mammal bone. This feature however depends very much on the original localization of the studied sample within the antler. Whale bones can be distinguished from the other osseous materials by a cancellous, osteoporotic-like structure with irregularly distributed rounded porosities with diameters reaching up to 500 μm. These characteristics have also been tested on determined Palaeolithic fragments, as diagenetic changes during burial have to be considered and may lead to the modification of the parameters established on the basis of modern bone references. In general, the chemical composition of bone objects can change drastically over time while micromorphological features, as evidenced by microCT, seem to be less susceptible to such alterations. In addition, microCT enables the comparison of inner and possibly less altered parts of the objects, and can be considered as completely non-destructive for small mineralised prehistoric objects. In this study, specific morphological features allowing the distinction of ivory and of whale bone from other bone and antler material were determined, even for altered materials dating back to Palaeolithic periods. Thus, we provide, in addition to archaeozoological, chemical and isotopic markers, a new non-destructive tool to identify some raw materials used for the fabrication of osseous objects ranging from recent to prehistoric periods.},

	abstract = {In the Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection, Berlin, a multitude of papyrus manuscripts are stored. Papyri found on Elephantine island are of special interest. No other settlement in Egypt has been so well documented through texts over four millennia. However, 80\% of the Elephantine texts are yet to be documented and published. As part of the “Elephantine” project, funded by an ERC starting grant, we attempt to gain access to hidden text. Most of the fragments are very fragile, deformed, with some rolled or folded. Papyri from the Old and Middle Kingdom were typically written with carbon ink. Consequently, these fragments show no absorption sensitivity for hard X-rays. Also, other inks have been used in those times. If small traces of high-Z elements, like Fe or Pb, are found, absorption may be sensitive enough for radiography and tomography to distinguish between writing and base material. We sorted out suitable fragments and papyrus packages by X-ray fluorescence mapping. When promising high-Z elements were detected, absorption tomography was applied using micro-CT laboratory systems or synchrotron X-rays at the BAMline at BESSY II. The sensitivity can be enhanced by element-sensitive absorption edge imaging, where transmission data taken above and below the edge are compared. This technique was applied at the absorption edges of the elements known to be used as ink and pigment material – Iron, Antimony and Lead. These X-ray results were complemented by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurements showing that the lead is found in the form of lead carboxylate. In the future, the presented methodology will be applied to folded or rolled papyri, allowing for analysis of the text without manually opening the fragments.},

With the development of crack-weakening theories (Ingles and Griffith) and the observation that surface damage enhances delayed failure, the scientific community recognized that delayed failure in glass is caused by the growth of cracks that are subjected to tensile stresses. Fracture mechanics techniques were used to quantify crack growth rates in terms of applied stress, temperature, and the chemical environments that cause subcritical crack growth. We review the theories that have been developed to rationalize subcritical crack growth data, including theories based on plastic deformation at the crack tip, chemical adsorption of the reacting species, and direct chemical reaction of the environment with the strained bonds at the crack tip. The latter theory seems to be most consistent with the finding that water reacts directly with the strained Si–O bond because of the ability of water to donate both electrons and protons to the strained bond. Other chemicals having this characteristic also cause subcritical crack growth. Finally, we review the quantum mechanical calculations that have been used to quantify the chemical reactions involved in subcritical crack growth.},

pieces are extremely fragile and require special conservation treatments. For the characterization
of the morphology and the thickness of the degradation layer mainly scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) is used. The preparation of samples to study cross-sections is invasive. As part of an
EC-project, microfocus x-ray computed tomography (mCT) was optimized for heavily corroded
glasses. The mCT device, equipped with a microfocus x-ray source and a CCD camera, is capable
of achieving a high resolution. The corrosion layers have a lower attenuation for x-rays than the
unaltered glass, resulting in contrasting grey values in the images obtained. The interpretation of
the images was achieved by calibrating the method with artificially corroded model glasses and
selected originals. With mCT, small fragments can be characterized non-destructively and their
internal features and external morphology can be visualized as 3D model.},

However, the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the reactions between glass and water in vapor state is fundamental to several fields such as glass industry, conservation of glasses of the cultural heritage and long-term assessment of nuclear waste glasses. This paper outlines the issues raised by the atmospheric alteration of glass in these fields and attempts to summarize the scientific approaches and findings of the three communities. This short review reveals that atmospheric alteration should not be confused with liquid alteration at high S/V (S = exposed surface of glass and V = volume of solution), because the kinetics and the nature of the alteration products are distinct. Notably, alkalies and non-bridging oxygens may be significantly retained in glass hydrated in unsaturated atmosphere, depending on the glass composition. Future lines of research are drawn to progress in the understanding of the specificities of atmospheric glass alteration.},

The technique does have limitations which are reviewed. Then, the usefulness of desktop Micro-CT scanners for the study of archaeological artefacts is demonstrated in a non-destructive study of manufacturing methods of Roman and Early Medieval monochrome and polychrome glass beads. Differences in glass colours show up in these scans as differences in attenuation. The presence and distribution of bubbles and various inclusions (metal, opacifier) are also well visible. Shaft shapes and patterns of bubbles inside the glass make it possible in most cases to distinguish between drawn, wound and constructed (millefiori) beads and to study shaping methods. Shafts shapes also reveal shapes and dimensions of the mandrels used in bad manufacture. Decoration and construction methods are be visualized and studied in virtual cross-sections and semi-3D rendered images of selected glass colours. Visible degradation processes - including fissuring, leaching (especially of opaque yellow glasses) and dissolution processes - are highlighted. The micro-CT scans demonstrate how quality of raw glass, base design and workmanship ion bead manufacture have improved with time. Moreover, it shows how these scans may serve as basis to discuss the organization of workshops where simple or more complex objects were made from non-metallic raw materials, and the availability and distribution of different qualities of raw materials for these workshops.},

	abstract = {Interactions between nuclear glass and Fe were investigated in a clayey environment to better understand the mechanisms and driving forces controlling the long-term behavior of high-level waste glass in a geological repository. An integrated experiment involving a Glass–Iron–Clay (GIC) stack was run at a laboratory scale in anoxic conditions for 2years and the interfaces were characterized by a multiscale approach using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman microspectroscopy and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy at the SLS Synchrotron. The characterization of glass alteration patterns on cross sections revealed an increase in glass alteration with the Fe content and the proximity between the glass and Fe. The alteration layers are polyphase and stratified with an inner porous gel layer incorporating Fe and an outer layer composed of nanocrystalline Fe-silicates. Several mechanisms which could affect the glass alteration kinetics and the transport properties of the alteration layer are proposed to explain this pattern: (i) consumption of hydrolyzed silica by precipitation of Fe-silicates; (ii) penetration of Fe within the gel porosity probably as precipitates such as Fe oxyhydroxide or Fe-silicates. These new data may imply some consequences when considering the long-term behavior of glass in geological disposal conditions.},

The high spatial and density resolution of the tomograph enable detailed insights into the individual work processes of the investigated cast plaster statues. While initiated in support of the conservation process, computed tomography (CT) analysis has assisted in revealing relative chronologies within the series of the cast works of art, thus serving as a valuable tool in the art-historical appraisal of the oeuvres. The image-processing systems visualize the voids and cracks within and the cuts through the original cast works. Internal structures, armoring, sculptural reworking as well as restorative interventions are virtually reconstructed. The authors are currently employing the 3D-µCT systems at the BAM into the detection of defects in Carrara marble sculpture. Microcracks, fractures, and material flaws are visualized at spatial resolution down to 10µm.

While it is speculated that these figurines were used for the study of medical education, little is known about their origins. A precise understanding of the composition of these figurines may further provide knowledge about their purpose and exact age. Our institution holds the largest North American collection of these figurines. Our purpose was to utilize micro-computer tomography (micro-CT) to determine the composition of these figurines and discern whether these figurines are made of “true” ivory (e.g., elephant or mammoth tusk) or other ivory-like materials (e.g., whale bone and antler). Scans of 22 figurines were performed on an XT H 225 ST Nikon Micro-CT (mCT) scanner at 150–200 kV, with an average exposure time of 267 ms, and slice thickness of 40–80 μm. Axial micro-CT slices were evaluated for Haversian canal structure/morphology to determine material composition. micro-CT images were also evaluated for materials other than ivory or bone that were not appreciable by visual inspection. Out of 22 figurines, 20 were made of ivory, one was made of antler, and one contained both ivory and whale bone. Metallic components and/or fibers were found in a minority of figurines. Twelve figurines contained hinges or internal repairs. micro-CT can be used to discern the composition of fragile archeological figurines and assess for repairs or alterations. This information may enable archeologists to draw conclusions regarding objects’ age, origins, and possible uses.},

The objective of this study was to determine the provenance of the raw glass and the secondary production procedures of the window-panes. Judging from the material evidence, both the crown window-panes and possibly the rectangular samples were produced through glass-blowing techniques. The chemical data show that the assemblage forms a homogeneous group of soda–lime–silica glass of the Levantine I type. The green glass, however, has higher silica and lower soda contents than the aqua-blue fragments. The composition of one sample suggested the recycling of Roman glass. Our results confirm the trade of glass between the Levantine coast and Petra during Late Antiquity. No colouring agents other than iron were detected. Spectrophotometry confirmed the presence of iron and showed that the window fragments absorbed light relatively equally across the visible part of the spectrum. The windows thus seem to have provided an almost colourless illumination for the sacred interior.},

	abstract = {The degradation mechanisms of glass in a buried context result in surfaces that have been depleted in various elements. The stability of the glass is primarily affected by the burial environment and the glass composition. However, in all archaeological glasses, the corroded layer that is formed on the surface tends to be low in alkalis, high in silica and lacking in cohesion. The extent to which the material has degraded, along with the physical nature of the corrosion, has a profound effect upon a wide range of factors affecting the stability of artefacts, as well as the choice of conservation techniques to be employed. This study has a number of objectives: determination of the morphology of the surface of the leached layer in glasses of two different compositions with different surface finishes; examination of the transition between the corroded material and the unaffected substrate; and investigation of concentration profile of different elements within the surface layers, as a function of depth. The study uses two glasses, fabricated under laboratory conditions, to replicate two common glass types found in the historical environment; a soda–lime–silica glass typical of those found in the Roman period throughout the Mediterranean and northwestern Europe, and high-lime–potash glasses typical of those of Western Europe in the late medieval period. Three different surfaces have been prepared to mimic alternative manufacturing techniques such as blown, cast and ground surfaces for each composition. The glasses have been corroded under controlled laboratory conditions to replicate the buried environment. Imaging and chemical information is obtained using SEM–EDX and morphological information using IFM to produce 3-D mapping from topographical surfaces.},

	abstract = {This thesis project is focused on the direct interactions between ancient glass objects and the soils where they were buried. The thesis aims to clarify the mechanism of ancient glass alteration. The physical-chemical properties, as well as the alteration patinas, of Roman glasses, found in the archaeological site of Aquileia (north of Italy), were investigated through Optical and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM-EDS) and Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). On parallel, the chemistry and the physical properties of the environmental soils, corresponding to the site of the archaeological findings, were studied in terms of elemental composition, though Microwave Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (MP-AES), and characterized through ion-exchange capacity, conductivity and pH measurements.  
 
Archaeological glass fragments developed alteration patterns – mainly pitting and iridescence, as well as discolouration - consistent with the centuries-long placement in burial environment. Specifically, the soil parameters considered with the intrinsic features of glasses explain the formation of different degradation marks on glass surface. The pH level of the soil and the cation exchange capacity resulted crucial in glass degradation. In particular, the glass samples with the highest degree of deterioration are associated to environmental soils characterized by low pH values and high cation exchange capacities.},

	abstract = {Ancient floor mosaics started to be used from the 2nd millennium BCE, while their structure was established during the Classic Era. From the 4th century BCE they were wide spread and systemized around the Mediterranean Basin, as a mean to decorate public buildings, private houses or open spaces (i.e. atriums). Their substrate, as well as the successiveness of the layers played an important role on their structure, enhancing their durability to environmental factors and external loading. In the present study four multilayer mortar samples from Hellenistic and Roman floor mosaic substrates of monuments from Northern Greece, were analyzed. The methodology concerned in situ, macroscopic and microstructure observation, as well as determination of the physical, mechanical and chemical properties of each layer but at the same time of the structure as a whole. The evaluation of the test results led to the identification of the characteristics of each mortar layer, such as the binding system type, the Binder/Aggregate ratio and the application technique followed. According to the study, all multilayer samples presented similar characteristics, such as: stratigraphy of four very well compacted layers, whose thickness was decreased towards the surface layer, binding system based on lime and natural pozzolan, increase of the Binder/Aggregate ratio upwards and decrease of aggregates' maximum size and porosity. A significant aspect was the good adhesion of the mortar layers, which was attributed to the layers' compaction, as well as to different technological factors.},

It will consider particular techniques required, and/or of benefit, for CXT of heritage materials, such as special precautions during the experimentation to ensure there is no damage to the materials, special imaging methods such as elemental-specific imaging, and sample-specific image analysis requirements. This study shows how the knowledge of internal features, particularly pores, discerned from CXT can be used to reverse engineer the artefact fabrication process. CXT can be used to obtain information on both the raw materials (such as types and impurities) and fabrication techniques used. These abilities can then be used to establish technological evolution and the incidence of ancient behaviours like recycling and allow the linking of particular items to specific production sites. It will also be seen how CXT can aid the development of effective conservation techniques. This work will also consider how conclusions drawn from CXT data can be amended or augmented by the use of complementary non-destructive characterisation methods, such as gas overcondensation. © 2024 by the author.},

	abstract = {Phoenician colonisation of the Iberian Peninsula in the 1st millennium BCE introduced many novel and luxurious goods to the local populations of the Western Mediterranean. Among them, black-appearing glass beads are characteristic of indigenous female burials in Southern Portugal during the 6th century BCE. This study presents the results of the first comprehensive archaeometric investigation of black-appearing glass from Vinha das Caliças 4 (Portugal), and of black-appearing glass from the Iberian Peninsula in general. A multi-analytical approach employing Stereomicroscopic observation of manufacture and use traces, VP-SEM-EDS, μ-XRD, and LA-ICP-MS was used to cover a wide range of questions regarding technology and provenance. All analysed samples are natron glass. All samples of black and white beads are characterized by high Zr and low Sr values typically ascribed to the use of Egyptian sands. A comparison of the results of previous studies from the same site clearly demonstrates at least two geochemical provenances for Phoenician-traded glass beads, located in the Levantine region and Egypt, respectively. Furthermore, different colours of glass in individual polychrome beads exhibit similar trace element patterns, which might suggest these beads could have been produced close to glassmaking sites/regions. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Four glass beads from a Scythian burial on the island of Khortytsia (Southern Ukraine) were subjected to 3D imaging using micro-CT and photogrammetry. The aim was to reconstruct the process used to produce and decorate the beads by detecting and interpreting the traces left by the technological processes on the bead surface and in the glass body. It turned out that all the beads were obtained by winding hot glass around the mandrel. The distribution, size and shape of the bubbles in the glass matrix revealed by the micro-CT scans and the features observed during a thorough examination of the photogrammetric models allowed us to follow the movements of the bead maker during the formation of the bead body and its decoration, highlighting several details of the production processes such as the number of the superimposed layers and the direction of the rotation of the mandrel during both the formation of the body and the decoration of the bead. Some information about the tools also emerged, with particular reference to the shape of the mandrel, the possible use of a releasing agent and how tools were used to decorate the surface or to remove the beads from the mandrel. According to the archaeological classification, the beads considered here belong to three different types, that are considered chronological indicators of the fourth century BCE and are found in archaeological sites spread over an area extending for several thousand kilometers from the Black Sea coast to the Ural Mountains. This work enriches the knowledge of the micromorphology of beads found in Eastern Europe, which is rarely discussed in the scientific literature on the archaeological glass beads. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Desktop micro-CT scanner has become a standard piece of equipment for many materials science laboratories and is increasingly popular in the field of archaeology for the study of archaeological soils and small archaeological artefacts. The technique does have limitations which are reviewed. Then, the usefulness of desktop Micro-CT scanners for the study of archaeological artefacts is demonstrated in a non-destructive study of manufacturing methods of Roman and Early Medieval monochrome and polychrome glass beads. Differences in glass colours show up in these scans as differences in attenuation. The presence and distribution of bubbles and various inclusions (metal, opacifier) are also well visible. Shaft shapes and patterns of bubbles inside the glass make it possible in most cases to distinguish between drawn, wound and constructed (millefiori) beads and to study shaping methods. Shafts shapes also reveal shapes and dimensions of the mandrels used in bad manufacture. Decoration and construction methods are be visualized and studied in virtual cross-sections and semi-3D rendered images of selected glass colours. Visible degradation processes - including fissuring, leaching (especially of opaque yellow glasses) and dissolution processes - are highlighted. The micro-CT scans demonstrate how quality of raw glass, base design and workmanship ion bead manufacture have improved with time. Moreover, it shows how these scans may serve as basis to discuss the organization of workshops where simple or more complex objects were made from non-metallic raw materials, and the availability and distribution of different qualities of raw materials for these workshops. © 2018},

Segmentation of these CT images is essential but challenging due to variation in grayscale values and the presence of bubbles. This study introduces a U-Net-based model called EBV-SegNet, which enables efficient and accurate segmentation and visualization of these beads. We developed, trained, and tested the model using a dataset comprising four typical Shampula dragonfly eye beads, and the results demonstrated high-precision segmentation and precise delineation of the beads’ complex structures. These segmented data were further analyzed using the Visualization Toolkit for advanced volume rendering and reconstruction. Our application of EBV-SegNet to Shampula beads suggests the likelihood of two distinct manufacturing techniques, underscoring the potential of the model for enhancing the analysis of cultural artifacts using three-dimensional visualization and deep learning.},

	volume = {13},
	abstract = {Depending on their composition and the exposure environment, historic glasses develop degradation phenomena, ranging from thin hydrated surface layers up to complete cracking all through the sample. Characterizing the degradation pattern is important to select the most adequate conservation strategy. Optical microscopy is the most frequently used non-destructive analysis methods to examine the surface of historic glass. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is applied to investigate the depth of damaged areas, although this requires the glass to be prepared as embedded cross sections and is thus limited to sacrificial samples. Computed X-ray tomography (CT) was adopted for detecting degradation layers on archaeological glasses by using a desktop tomography scanner. Limitations were encountered when the treatment of degraded glasses with organic polymers needed to be evaluated. The highly coherent X-ray beam available at the SYRMEP bending magnet beamline at ELETTRA offers the possibility to investigate glasses by phase sensitive (PS) micro-tomography. Historic glasses from archaeological context and samples taken from naturally weathered stained glass windows were examined during a measurement campaign in 2007. The results demonstrate the potential of phase sensitive micro-CT to illustrate not only the corrosion patterns of glasses but also the conservation treatments. In one prominent example the consolidation of a cracked archaeological sample with Paraloid B72 could be followed. The visualization of the 3D-structure of fragile objects can be used to optimize conservation treatments.},
